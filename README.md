# UNO!

This project is a python implementation of the card game UNO! using object-oriented programming to create buttons, cards, decks of cards, and the game itself. The game is played between the user and a computer, and ends when one player has no remaining cards in their hand. Further rules can be found in uno_rules.txt, or ingame by clicking the "RULES" button.
