# UNO!

This project is a python implementation of the card game UNO! using object-oriented programming to create buttons, cards, decks of cards, and the game itself. The game is played between the user and a computer, and ends when one player has no remaining cards in their hand. Further rules can be found in uno_rules.txt, or ingame by clicking the "RULES" button.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run UNO.py from the terminal or any code editor.

## Further Work

Incorporate more special cards like color-changing cards, +4, skip, etc. Possibly even a third or fourth player and a reverse card.
More house-rules and the options to enable or disable them, calling out opponents in case they didn't have to play a +4, stacking cards, jumping in.
Fleshing out the computer-controlled opponent to use cards more strategically, possibly incorporating a difficulty setting.
Multiplayer, take your turn, click a button to hide your hand, opponent can now look at the screen and click a button to show their hand, continue cyclically.
